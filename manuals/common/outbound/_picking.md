## Process: Picking

**Picking** is retrieving items from storage to fulfill orders. The WMS generates a pick list and supports methods like single order, batch, and zone picking. [cite: 528, 529] This optimizes accuracy and timeliness. 

### How to Pick an Order via HHT

1. **Navigate to Pick**: On the HHT, go to the **Pick** menu. 
2. **Select Pick**: Open the assigned **Pick Number** from the list. 
3. **Scan Trolley**: Scan the **TO LPN** (trolley) barcode to associate it with the pick. 
4. **Scan Location**: Proceed to the location shown on the screen and scan the **Location Number** barcode. 
5. **Scan Item**: Scan the **Item Number** barcode. For bulk picking, enable the "multiple quantity" checkbox and enter the quantity. 
6. **Handle Exceptions**:
  * **Product Not Available (PNA)**: If an item is not found, tap the **PNA** button and submit the reason. 
  * **Trolley Full**: If the trolley is full, click **Change Pallet** and scan a new TO LPN. 
7. **Register Pick**: Click the **Register** button to confirm the items picked. The system will auto-register if the entire pick is completed.
