# Module: Outbound Logistics

The **Outbound Process** in WMS manages the dispatch of goods through steps like Order Allocation, Picking, Packing, and Shipping. These tasks can be performed via Web or HHT for B2B, B2C, and return orders. The system ensures accuracy with validations, quality checks, and inventory updates for timely and error-free order fulfillment. 

### Outbound Process Overview

* **Sales Order**: Create and allocate sales orders for outbound processing. 
* **Pick**: This includes pick creation, assigning picks to users, or allowing users to self-assign picks. [cite: 26, 27, 28, 29] On HHT, users scan location and SKU, enter quantity, and confirm the pick. 
* **Pack**: Scan the box code, pack SKUs, verify weights (if applicable), and confirm packing. [cite: 31, 32]
* **Manifest**: Generate and assign shipment details to the transporter. 
* **Ship**: Finalize the shipment, print shipping labels, and confirm dispatch.
