## Process: Managing Approvals

The Approvals module provides a centralized dashboard to review and approve or reject changes requested within the WMS. [cite: 108, 109, 125] This is used for actions such as approving updates to LPN inventory details (like MRP, Lot No., Expiry Date) or approving a short dispatch for an order. [cite: 103, 418] The approval detail screen shows the current data alongside the proposed updated data, with buttons to **Approve** or **Decline** the change.
