# Module: Inbound Logistics

The **Inbound Process** streamlines the receipt and management of incoming goods, from Purchase Order (PO) to Putaway. It ensures accurate verification, real-time tracking, and optimized storage, with operations executable via both HHT and web interfaces. 

### Inbound Process Overview

The inbound process consists of several key steps:
* **PO (Purchase Order)** – Manage purchase requests. 
* **ASN (Advanced Shipment Notice)** – Pre-register incoming shipments. 
* **Gate In** – Record a vehicle's entry into the facility. 
* **Gate Entry** – Log shipment details at the entry point. 
* **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)** – Verify and document all received goods. 
* **Putaway** – Systematically store goods in their designated locations.
