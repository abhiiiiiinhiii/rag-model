## Process: Creating an Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)

The **ASN** provides early visibility of incoming shipments. An ASN is created based on a Purchase Order (PO), and its quantity must be less than or equal to the PO quantity. Multiple ASNs can be made for a single PO to manage partial shipments. 

### How to Create an ASN

1. **Access ASN Section**: Navigate to **Inbound** > **ASN**. 
2. **Initiate New ASN**: Click the **New ASN** button. 
3. **Select PO**: From the dropdown list, select the **PO Number** the ASN is linked to. 
4. **Enter or Upload Details**: You can either fill in all mandatory fields manually or click **Upload**. [cite: 503, 504, 506]
  * To upload, click **Download** to get the template, fill it with SKU numbers and quantities, and upload it back to the system. [cite: 508, 509, 510]
5. **Confirm ASN**: Click the **Confirm** button to finalize the ASN creation. The system will display a success message.
