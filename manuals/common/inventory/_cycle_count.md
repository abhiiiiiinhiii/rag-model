## Process: Cycle Count

The **Cycle Count** feature allows for periodic inventory counts to ensure accuracy without needing a full physical inventory. This helps identify discrepancies and maintain inventory integrity. A cycle count cannot be performed on a location if it has inventory blocked for an order. 

### How to Perform a Cycle Count via Web

1. **Navigate**: Go to **Inventory > Cycle Count**. 
2. **Start New Count**: Click **New Cycle Count**. 
3. **Scan Location**: In the form, scan the **Address**, **LPN No**, and **Item No**. Other details like Lot No or Expiry Date may also be required. 
4. **Handle Empty Bins**: If a bin is found to be empty, click the **Empty Bin** button. This moves all expected inventory for that bin to a suspense location. 
5. **View Discrepancies**: After scanning, the table will show the found quantity versus the expected, highlighting any **excess** or **suspense** (missing) quantity. 
6. **Submit**: When finished, click **Confirm & Submit**. The cycle count status becomes **“To Be Adjusted”**. 
7. **Supervisor Action**: A supervisor can then view the cycle count and choose to **Adjust** the inventory accordingly or **Reject** the count.
