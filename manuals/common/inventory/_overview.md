# Module: Inventory Management

The **Inventory** module is the core of WMS operations, used to track and manage stock levels within the warehouse. It ensures inventory accuracy and enables efficient handling of stock. The module is primarily divided into two sub-modules: **Full Inventory** and **Bin-wise Inventory**. [cite: 687, 688] Key functions include viewing stock levels, performing physical verification, and managing stock adjustments and transfers. [cite: 690, 691, 692]
