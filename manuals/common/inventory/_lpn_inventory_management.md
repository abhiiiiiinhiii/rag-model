## Process: LPN Inventory Management

**LPN Inventory** allows for viewing and managing inventory at the individual License Plate Number (LPN) level. This is useful for correcting item details like MRP, manufacturing/expiry dates, or lot numbers post-GRN. [cite: 103, 104]

### How to Edit LPN Inventory Details

1. **Navigate**: Go to **Inventory > LPN Inventory**. 
2. **Select LPN**: Choose a specific **LPN** from the dropdown list. 
3. **Edit Details**: Click the **pencil icon** next to an item, then click the **Edit** button in the pop-up. [cite: 117, 119] Make the required changes to fields like Lot No, MRP, or dates. 
4. **Submit for Approval**: Click **Submit**. The changes are automatically sent for approval via email and to the **Approval Module** in the WMS. [cite: 123, 124, 125]
5. **Approval**: The updates are applied to the inventory only after they are approved. If rejected, the original details are retained.
