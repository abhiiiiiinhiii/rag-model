# Module: Returns Management

The **Return** module handles returned goods, dividing the process into two main types: **Purchase Order Returns** (items returned to vendors) and **Sales Order Returns** (items returned by customers). [cite: 873, 874] This ensures proper inventory adjustments and reporting for all return operations.
