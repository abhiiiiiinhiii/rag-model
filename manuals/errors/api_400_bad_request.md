This error indicates that the data sent to the server was incorrect or incomplete, so the server could not understand the request.

## Common Causes
- A required field in a form was left empty.
- Data was entered in the wrong format (e.g., text in a number-only field).
- An invalid option was selected from a dropdown list.

## Solution for Users
Please review the form you just submitted. Check that all required fields are filled out and that the data is in the correct format. For example, ensure that quantity fields only contain numbers. Correcting any visible errors on the form and resubmitting should resolve the issue.
